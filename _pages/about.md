<!-- Feng Xue will be a postdoctoral researcher working with Prof. [Nicu Sebe](http://disi.unitn.it/~sebe/) at the [Multimedia and Human Understanding Group (MHUG)](http://mhug.disi.unitn.it/), University of Trento, Italy. -->
Previously, he earned his Ph.D. degree in computer science and technology (2023) from the Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications (BUPT),
and his MA.Eng. degree in computer technology (2019) from BUPT, China.
His Ph.D. thesis advisor is Prof. [Anlong Ming](http://www.vrobotit.cn/~mal),
and he also works closely with Prof. [Yu Zhou](https://yuzhou.vlrlab.net/).
His research interests lie in **Open-World Visual Perception** for Robots and **Open-Domain Generalization**.


<!-- Since 2017, I have been focusing on **open-world visual perception using a monocular camera**, which is applied to scenarios such as autonomous driving and robotics. To this end, during my master's study, I focused on **perceiving tiny anomalous objects** in autonomous driving scenarios using low-level visual primitives and mid-level visual representations. During my PhD study, I devoted to introducing the 3D scene structure and the scene context into the open-world visual perception by **estimating metric depth and detecting the free space of autonomous driving**. -->
